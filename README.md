# Elasticsearch for Swift 3.0

Implements the transport side of Elasticsearch using minimal dependencies. Based loosely on the official Elasticsearch clients.

The client supports both asynchronous requests and also synchronous requests with retry. Asynchronous requests do not retry at this point.

Error handling is done in an elegant Swift like fashion.

More documentation will occur as the version increases...
